### Database Schema
Rooms are stored in Firestore with the following structure:

{
  name: string,
  isPrivate: boolean,
  isDM: boolean,          // New field for DM detection
  ownerId: string,
  members: string[],
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  updatedAt: Timestamp
}
```

### API Endpoints Used
- `POST /api/rooms` - Create rooms and DMs
- `GET /api/rooms` - List user's rooms
- `POST /api/rooms/[id]/members` - Manage room members
- `GET /api/rooms/[id]` - Get room details

### Component Hierarchy
```
RoomDashboard
├── RoomList
│   └── CreateRoomModal
└── EnhancedUserList

ChatInterface (Enhanced)
├── RoomSettings (Modal)
└── EnhancedUserList (Modal for invites)
```

## Current Status

The room and DM functionality is **fully implemented and ready for use**. The implementation includes:

- ✅ Complete room creation system
- ✅ Direct messaging functionality
- ✅ User invitation system
- ✅ Room management interface
- ✅ API backend support
- ✅ Navigation integration
- ✅ Error handling and validation

### Known Limitations
- Some TypeScript configuration warnings (environmental, not functional issues)
- UI styling could be further customized to match design preferences
- Real-time room updates could be added for live member changes

## Next Steps for Enhancement

1. **Real-time room updates** - Add live member join/leave notifications
2. **Room search and discovery** - Public room browsing
3. **Room categories/tags** - Organization features
4. **File sharing in rooms** - Enhanced media support
5. **Room-specific permissions** - Moderator roles and permissions

The implementation provides a solid foundation for chat room functionality and can be extended with additional features as needed.
