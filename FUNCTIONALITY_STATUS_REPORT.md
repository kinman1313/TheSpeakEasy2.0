## ⚠️ **KNOWN ISSUES TO FIX**

### 🔥 **Critical Issues**
1. **WebRTCProvider Disabled** - Video/voice calls unavailable due to SSR Firebase issues
2. **SettingsProvider Disabled** - User settings functionality unavailable
3. **Firebase SSR** - Other providers may have same undefined import issue as AuthProvider had

### 🛠️ **Required Fixes**
```javascript
// Apply same SSR fix pattern to other providers:
export function WebRTCProvider({ children }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const initializeWebRTC = async () => {
      const { rtdb } = await import("@/lib/firebase");
      // Initialize WebRTC functionality safely
    };
    initializeWebRTC();
  }, []);
}
```

### 📱 **Media Permissions**
- Need to test camera/microphone permissions on first run
- Error handling for denied permissions
- Fallback UI for devices without camera/microphone

---

## 🧪 **TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS**

### 1. **Test Voice Calls** 
```bash
# After fixing WebRTCProvider SSR issue:
1. Join a room with 2 users
2. Start voice chat
3. Test mute/unmute functionality
4. Verify participant list updates
```

### 2. **Test Video Calls**
```bash
# After fixing WebRTCProvider SSR issue:
1. Initiate video call between users
2. Test camera/audio controls
3. Verify call status messages
4. Test call accept/decline/hangup
```

### 3. **Test Media Features**
```bash
1. Record and send voice message
2. Search and send GIFs
3. Add emoji reactions to messages
4. Test emoji picker categories
```

## 🎉 **CONCLUSION**

The chat application is **extensively featured** with professional-grade functionality including:
- ✅ Real-time messaging with reactions
- ✅ Full emoji support  
- ✅ WebRTC voice/video calling (needs provider fix)
- ✅ Voice messages and GIF sharing
- ✅ User authentication and presence

**The core issue is SSR Firebase imports**, which we already solved for AuthProvider. The same pattern needs to be applied to remaining providers to unlock full functionality.

**Estimated time to full working state: 4 hours**
