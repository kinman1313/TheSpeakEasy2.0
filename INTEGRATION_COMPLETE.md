- Set up WebRTC signaling through Firebase
- Enable call notifications and sound effects
- Provide mobile-optimized calling interface

### **Making Calls:**
1. **Desktop**: Click the phone/video icons next to user names in the user list
2. **Mobile**: Tap the phone icon in the header to see online users and call them
3. **Incoming Calls**: Automatic ringtone, vibration, and visual notification
4. **During Calls**: Touch-friendly controls for mute, video toggle, and hang up

## 📱 **Mobile Experience:**

### **Touch-Friendly Interface:**
- Large, easy-to-press call control buttons
- Haptic feedback for all interactions
- Auto-hiding controls during video calls
- Landscape orientation lock for video calls

### **Smart Notifications:**
- System notifications with call actions
- Vibration patterns for different call events
- Ringtones with fallback beep sounds

## 🎵 **Sound System:**

### **Automatic Sound Effects:**
- **Ringtone**: When receiving calls (`/sounds/call1.mp3`)
- **Dialing**: When placing calls (`/sounds/call2.mp3`)
- **Connected**: When call connects (`/sounds/dm1.mp3`)
- **Ended**: When call ends (`/sounds/dm2.mp3`)

### **Fallback System:**
- Web Audio API beeps if sound files fail to load
- Silent operation if permissions are denied
- Volume control respects user settings

## 🔧 **Technical Architecture:**

### **Provider Chain:**
```
AuthProvider → CustomThemeProvider → SettingsProvider → WebRTCProvider → App
```

### **Component Hierarchy:**
```
ChatApp
├── ImprovedVideoCallView (when in call)
├── IncomingCallDialog (when receiving call)
├── Mobile Call Picker (mobile interface)
└── Enhanced Call Controls (integrated)
```

### **Signaling Flow:**
```
User A → Socket.IO Server → User B
      ↘ Firebase RTDB ↗
```
